Login using your GitHub account.\r\n2. Once you logged in, you will see the list of your repositories.\r\n3. If you select a repository, you will see a list of files in the repository.\r\n4. If you select a file, an editor will be opened.\r\n5. Edit a file in the editor. (Learn the command mode keybind)\r\n6. After you finish the editing, go back by swiping right.\r\n7. If you have proper dummyServer.js, you can run locally with your change.\r\n8. You can check diffs before commit.\r\n9. After entering a commit message, you can commit the change.\r\n10. If you have Codeship configured properly, you can deploy it to Heroku.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
